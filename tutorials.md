Due to computation and time constraints, these tutorials were formulated to work with a limited short read dataset aiming for the analysis of small genome/genetic sequences (e.g., mtDNA and rDNA).

These tutorials were adapted from the [Mitogenomes relesease v.2024.1](https://github.com/depaulats/Mitogenomes/releases/tag/v.2024.1) used in [De Paula et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.18255) and [Leite et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12041-024-01485-7).
